SOP theme : Let's go Contactless

We identified the need to go contact-less especially while checking-in as well as out during office hours in corporate houses as well as govt. institutions.
It's an alarming need post lockdown knowing the harsh consequences this pandemic had brought-in. 
Thus, to inculcate this very need of being contact-less in our new-normal daily routine, we thought to take the aid of trending tech-blend and come out with an implementable 
solution to kill the raised concern.

Our basic idea is to keep a tight check on the entry module of any office and this we are going to perform via matching the unique IDs of the entering employees with the 
authorized entries(already saved in the concerned company's database). 
If it matches, the person would be considered an authorized one to claim for entering within, otherwise not.
